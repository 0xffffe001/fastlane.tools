Fastlane
--------
So you can focus on the release party, instead of the actual release ðŸŽ‰

### [deliver](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver)
> Upload app screenshots, app metadata and ipa files to iTunes Connect using just one command.

### [snapshot](https://github.com/KrauseFx/snapshot)
> Automatically take screenshots of your iOS app on all devices in multiple languages.

### [sigh](https://github.com/KrauseFx/sigh)
> Sigh... having code signing issues again? Let sigh create and maintain provisioning profiles for you.

### [PEM](https://github.com/KrauseFx/frameit)
> You have to look up how to create a PEM file for your push server every year? No more!

### [frameit](https://github.com/KrauseFx/frameit)
> Add a device frame around your screenshots for your website or print.


Why should I automate?
----------------------

- Save **days** of preparing app submission, uploading screenshots and releasing the app
- Deploy from any computer, even your Continuous Integration server
- Implement a **Continuous Deployment** process. Just trigger ```fastlane``` and you're good to go
- Store **everything** in git. Never look up the used build commands in the ```Jenkins``` configs again
- Never remember any difficult commands, just ```fastlane```
- Define different ```deployment lanes``` for App Store deployment, beta builds or testing
