# Features
- Connect all tools, part of the ```fastlane``` tool chain in a meaningful way
- Define different ```deployment lanes``` for App Store deployment, beta builds or testing
- Deploy from any computer
- Never remember any difficult commands, just ```fastlane```
- Store **everything** in git. Never lookup the used build commands in the ```Jenkins``` configs
- Saves you **hours** of preparing app submission, uploading screenshots and deploying the app for each update.
- Once up and running, you have a fully working **Continuous Deployment** process. Just trigger ```fastlane``` and you're good to go.
